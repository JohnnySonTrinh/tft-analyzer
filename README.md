# TFT Analyzer ðŸ§ ðŸ“Š

Track your comps, placements, and performance in Teamfight Tactics using Riotâ€™s API. This is a personal data analysis project to explore patterns, improve my own gameplay, and grow my data skills.

## Goals
- Learn how to fetch and clean data using Python
- Analyze my own match history, traits, augments, and items
- Visualize trends like average placement per comp or win rates by augments
- Eventually build a simple dashboard or report

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas & Matplotlib
- Riot Games API (TFT)
- Jupyter Notebook (for analysis)
